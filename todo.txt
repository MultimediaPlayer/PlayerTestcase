Split the source video file into two different .mp4 files – one containing only video track and another containing only audio track.
Encode the file containing only the video track into as many quality levels as needed.
Encrypt all the different video files and the audio file.
Package all the required media files – all video files with different bitrate and audio file – into many segments (each in a separate file, representing a slice of the media for a specific duration) and also create a manifest. The DASH video is now ready.
